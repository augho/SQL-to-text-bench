## Question/SQL query lists

Taken from 2 GitHub repositories
- [query_list_1.json](https://github.com/LucasMcL/15-sql_queries_02-chinook/blob/master/chinook-queries.sql)

- [query_list_2.json](https://github.com/Sunil1896/Chinook-Database-Analysis)

The first one has very descriptive queries with a wording that matches the tables and fields and is very unnatural so I also added a more natural tone question so the list looks like so

```json
{
    "id": "An integer",
    "easy_question": "Original question from the repo",
    "query": "More natural question",
    "sql": "Matching sql query"
}
```
